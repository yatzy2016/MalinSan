		<h1>Properties of acids</h1>
		<img src="Bilder/acid.png" title="Acid">
		Acids are complex chemical substances which contain
		hydrogen atoms that can be substituted by the atom of metal to form a salt.
		Acids differ in basicity: Basicity is determined by the number of hydrogen
		atoms included in their composition. For example, sulphur - H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><p>
		</p>- dibasic, because it is composed of 2 hydrogen atoms. 
		Acid also share on <strong>oxygen</strong>
		<i>-containing and not containing oxygen.</i>
		For example, HC<sub>l</sub> - does not contain atoms of oxygen,
		and H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub><br><p> 
		</p>-<i>carbonic acid contains 3 atoms</i> of oxygen and is oxygenated.
